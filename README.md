# 🚀 30-Day Data Challenge

Welcome to my *30-Day Data Challenge*!  
For 30 consecutive days, I'm committing to build, analyze, or visualize one small data project every day. Each project will help reinforce my skills in *data analysis, **data science, **machine learning, and data tools like **Python, **Pandas, **Seaborn, **SQL, **Power BI, and **Kaggle*.

## 🎯 Challenge Goals

- Learn by doing — every single day
- Improve in:
  - Data cleaning & exploration
  - Data visualization
  - Statistical analysis
  - Machine learning modeling
  - Documentation and project structuring
- Build a public portfolio of daily projects
